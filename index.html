    <p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of English at Texas A&M University. I received my MA in English from Georgia College & State University and my BA in English and European History from Washington and Lee University. My scholarly interests include early modern English drama, digital humanities, history of the book, materiality, and canonicity. My dissertation, tentatively titled “‘With the losers let it sympathize’: Shakespeare in Collection and the Formation of the Canon,” focuses on the relationship between seventeenth-century printed collections of Shakespeare’s works and the creation of the early modern dramatic canon.</p>
